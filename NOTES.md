# Project Notes

## Planing
Capibaras memory game. The user will see a grid of 4x4 of different capibaras images (GIFs from GIPHY using their API). The idea of the game is that the user memorizes the selection he/she makes in each turn. Each selection if its not repeated gives 1 point. Is game over when the user repeats the selection. For this we need a UI that is like the following.
Game Title.
Game Instructions
Score Count and Best Score
Grid 4x4 that shuffles what gets displayed each time so it is difficult for the user
Footer with info from the author
In terms of UX I think that the user can just start playing when the page renders and then when the game finished we can show a modal saying game over and when the user click outside of it the game restarts
I think that what we need is:
Object that has the 16 links from GIPHY that are going to be displayed
Function that generates a random list of 16 numbers that are displayed each time on the grid
Function that displays the Squares of the Grid (each one should have the GIFs and a tiny description)
Something that keeps track of which numbers / GIFs where selected
Something that keeps track of the score and best score of the session
